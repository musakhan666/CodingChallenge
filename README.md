Libraries used in the Project are as follow:


Jetpack:->
Jetpack is a suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on the code they care about.

Jetpack Navigation: ->
Android Jetpack's Navigation Component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer. To be more specific, the Navigation component is a collection of libraries, a plug-in, and tooling that simplifies Android navigation.

Jetpack LiveData: ->
LiveData Overview Part of Android Jetpack. LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.

Databinding ->
Data binding is the process that establishes a connection between the app UI and the data it displays. ... Data binding can also mean that if an outer representation of the data in an element changes, then the underlying data can be automatically updated to reflect the change.

Dagger 2 ->
In Dagger 2, that set is defined by an interface with methods that have no arguments and return the desired type. By applying the @Component annotation to such an interface and passing the module types to the modules parameter, Dagger 2 then fully generates an implementation of that contract.


Lottie -> 
Lottie is a library for Android, iOS, Web, and Windows that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively.


				Architecture used in this Project

MVVM using view model Factory and implementing Dagger 2 with it.
